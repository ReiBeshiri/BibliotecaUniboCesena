Gate info:

If multiple gates are arranged with short distances (1-8m) between each other, these will
mutually interfere with each other. In this case, the readers for the individual gates have to
be synchronized and run in one of the automatic modes.
The antenna should be at least 50 cm away from metal parts.
If multiple gates are operated at the same time at a distance of less than 8 m, the Readers
must by synchronized. See Application Note Synchronizing RFID Long Range Readers using
the digital in-/outputs (N10311-xe-ID-B.pdf).
A door (including glass doors), a curtain and in particular automatic doors or other moving objects
can influence the counting of the People Counter much (p26).
If two people (or moving objects) move, simultaneously, in the detection area of one radar sensor,
usually, is counted one person, only. 
The minimum distance between two people, so that these people are detected separately, as a
function of the adjusted sensitivity and position in the passage is 60 cm to 130 cm.
Software config (tuning ) p.40 after config:
If the values are not proper, check the following:
• Are the ring cores installed in the antenna cable?
• Are other RFID systems installed closed by?
• Are there large metal parts close to the antenna (distance < 1.0 m)?
• Are there devices nearby which may emit noise interferences (larger machines or wireless
devices)?
• Are there interferences from the mains?
The Counter values in the display will be updated every 30 seconds.
The gate has to be used in one of the Automatic Modes (Buffered Read, Notification
or Scan Mode) to get a maximum performance. Otherwise the reading performance
will be significantly reduced.
By people with small distances, due to interferences, and by cross traffic, can vary the determined
values of the actual values.
